class_name Rules
extends RefCounted

## Shipped turn-economy rules: the values a walker gains by entrenching, being patched up in a City
## or sitting out a turn, and the upkeep / WAIT arithmetic that applies them. The engine, Battlefield,
## the HUD and the Rules page all read the values through the accessors below, which let
## tests/balance.gd swap in experimental values per faction via BalanceProbe without production code
## depending on a test harness for its defaults. BalanceProbe counters are bumped here, in the same
## order as when this code lived in Battlefield.

## DEF bonus (%) an entrenched defender gets in a skirmish.
const ENTRENCH_DEF_PCT: int = 15
## Armor repaired by a WAIT / REFUEL order while holding a City (the field "patch").
const PATCH_ARMOR: int = 8
## Armor repaired by start-of-turn upkeep on a City tile.
const UPKEEP_ARMOR: int = 12

## Start-of-phase upkeep for one walker on `tile`: clears last turn's orders, then (optionally)
## applies passive diesel refuel, reactor energy regen, plus City Depot resupply (+CITY_ENERGY) and
## repairs (+UPKEEP_ARMOR). Returns the armor repaired so the caller can log it: this class must
## stay free of autoload references (scripts run with `godot -s` compile before autoloads exist).

## WAIT / REFUEL order shared by both factions: ends the walker's turn entrenched (+ENTRENCH_DEF_PCT
## DEF), restores up to WAIT_FUEL Fuel and WAIT_ENERGY Energy, and patches +PATCH_ARMOR when holding
## a City (`tile`). Returns fuel gained.
