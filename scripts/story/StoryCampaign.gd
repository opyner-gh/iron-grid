## The story mode's script: a linear list of chapters (prologue, twelve missions in three acts,
## epilogue). A "scene" chapter is portrait dialog only; a "mission" chapter is briefing dialog, a
## map (StoryMaps), mid-mission triggers (StoryDirector) and debrief dialog.
##
## Chapter keys: id, kind ("scene" / "mission"), act, title, synopsis, bg (cutscene backdrop id: a
## picture in assets/story/backdrops), and for scenes "lines"; for missions "map", "pre",
## "post", "post_bg", "triggers", "lose_if_lost", "win_if_down", "win_text", "second_wind" (pilots who
## get a second wind without being must-survive), "win_requires" (trigger id that must have fired
## before the map's own rules may award the victory).
## A dialog line is {"who": StoryCast id ("" = narrator), "text", optional "as": name shown instead}.
